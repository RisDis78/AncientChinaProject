<h1>Evidence:</h1><img src="Chinese_Coins.jpg" style="height: 300px; width:500px;" align="right">
<table>
    <p>
        <tr><td>Extra food was allowed to be traded. When farmers grew crops on terraces and double cropped on farmland</td></tr>

<h1>Reasoning</h1>
<table>
    
<tr><td>This proves trade does affect culture because now that there is extra food to trade people can go to bed full and satisfied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>More traditions can take place since the economy is booming. They can also use the extra food to their beloved dead one’s shrine.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>When emperor Shi Huangdi introduced the first coins it made a easier way to trade. Many things or certain money making industries can affect culture.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>While these are the upsides there are also downsides to economy. When it is traded to a mass scale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Businesses can be corrupt when money is on the table.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Such as FIFA and many other businesses. They can take away food from the poor and give it to the rich.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Since high demand and low supply can shoot up anything in sky high prices.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>This can affect culture because now nobody has enough food to eat other than the rich and offerings to the shrine aren’t given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>These events can also happen like when Japan went to war with the U.S. Many were impoverished and unsatisfied during the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Since the money went to the government to fulfill the needs of soldiers to win the war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Again the food when to the rich because of the benefits economy has when they favor rich over poor.</td></tr>
